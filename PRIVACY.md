# Privacy Policy for Otomatn

**Effective Date:** December 25, 2025

## Introduction
"Otomatn" ("we", "us", or "our") is a browser extension designed to refine and format Persian text. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how our extension handles your data.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
**We do not collect, store, share, or sell any of your personal data.**

The "Otomatn" extension operates entirely **locally** on your device (client-side).
* **No Remote Servers:** The text you process using this extension is never transmitted to any external server, database, or third-party service.
* **No Analytics:** We do not use any third-party analytics tools (like Google Analytics) to track your usage.
* **No User Accounts:** You do not need to create an account or log in to use the extension.

## 2. Permissions and Technical Access
To function correctly, "Otomatn" requires specific browser permissions. Here is how and why we use them:

* **activeTab / scripting:** When you click the extension icon or use the context menu, we access the *currently selected text* on your active tab solely to import it into the extension's editor for formatting. This access is temporary and triggered only by your direct action.
* **contextMenus:** This allows us to add the "Fix with Otomatn" option to your right-click menu.
* **storage:** We use the browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) strictly to temporarily pass the selected text from the web page to the extension's popup window. This data is not synced to the cloud and is cleared or overwritten with each new use.

## 3. Data Retention
Since we do not collect any data, we do not have a data retention policy. The text you edit exists only within the extension's temporary memory while you are using it. Once you close the extension popup or the browser, the data is cleared.

## 4. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
